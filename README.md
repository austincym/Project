# The Problem 
In 2022, the number of missing person files in the United States equaled 546,568 cases. Around 90,000 a year are never found, that's almost 1 million people in the last decade. Around the world people that go missing are not always reported, so the real number is actually going to be more than what is really reported. With new technologies and more thought out ways more and more people are going missing due to the advances in soceity.

# Strategy and Implementation


# Data Deck
Our data deck is a curated collection of diverse datasets containing images and relevant information related to missing persons. The dataset includes:

- Facial images from various sources
- Location data
- Time-stamped images to track movement
- Additional contextual information

- Iterative Improvement: Iterative model improvement often involves refining datasets. By collecting additional data, removing noisy or irrelevant samples, or augmenting the dataset, the model's performance can be enhanced.
  
- Quality of Predictions: The quality and representativeness of the dataset directly impact the quality of predictions made by machine learning models. A comprehensive dataset helps the model generalize well to new, unseen data.

- A high-quality, well-curated dataset is essential for training accurate, unbiased, and reliable machine learning models. It serves as the foundation upon which models learn and make predictions, influencing their performance and real-world applicability.

# AlexNet Filters
AlexNet is a powerful convolutional neural network (CNN) that we use as a key component of our image recognition system. The AlexNet filter enables us to:

- Identify unique facial features
- Perform image classification
- Enhance image recognition accuracy
# Pose

# WandB
We integrate Weights & Biases (WandB) to streamline our model training and experimentation process. Key features of our WandB integration include:

- Real-time monitoring of model training metrics
- Experiment tracking for model comparison
- Collaborative sharing of experiment results
- Model versioning and reproducibility
